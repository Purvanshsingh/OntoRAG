# OntoRAG

**Ontology-Grounded Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models**

OntoRAG is an open-source Python module that implements the OG-RAG framework described in our research paper. By integrating domain-specific ontologies with large language model (LLM) pipelines through a hypergraph-based retrieval system, OntoRAG enhances factual accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and improves context attribution in generated responses.

## Overview

Modern LLMs often struggle with domain-specific accuracy and context verification. OntoRAG addresses these challenges by:
- **Ontology Integration:** Leveraging structured domain knowledge to guide the retrieval process.
- **Hypergraph-Based Retrieval:** Transforming ontology-mapped data into hyperedges to efficiently extract relevant context.
- **Enhanced Reliability:** Boosting factual recall and interpretability, making it ideal for applications in agriculture, healthcare, legal research, and more.

This repository provides a complete, end-to-end implementation of the OG-RAG framework, enabling researchers and developers to quickly integrate robust retrieval-augmented generation into their projects.
